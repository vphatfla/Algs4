2-3 tree
Allow 1 or 2 keys per node
    2-node: 1 key, 2 childrens, which are less and greater than the node
    3-node: 2 keys, 3 childrens, which are less than the left key, between 2 keys, and greater than the right key.

Performance: guarrante the symmatric of the graph, balance
All method: clgN run time, c depends upon implementation

--> too complicated, could do better
