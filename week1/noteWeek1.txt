Quick-Union Improvements
1. Weighting:
    Modify quick-union to avoid tall trees
    Keep track of size of each tree
    Balance by linking root of smaller tree to root of larger tree
2.  Path compression
    id[i] = id[id[i]]
    keep the tree flat
3. Application
    Percolation:
        n-n grid
        percolated if there is a connection from the top to bottom
