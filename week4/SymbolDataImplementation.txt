1. Unorder linked list of key-value pairs
    ex: (key1 - value1)-(key2 - value2) ...
    search: have to scan through the whole keys until find a match --> N
    insert: have to scan through the whole keys to find a match, if not insert new key-value --> N in worst case

2. Two(2) parallel arrays contain key-value
    Keep them in order
    Seach: use binary search --> log(N)
    Insert: have to move all of the greater keys to the right ---> N

ST implementation       worstcase           average case        order
                     search      insert      search  insert
linked list         N           N            N/2        N       no
2-array             log(N)      N            log(N)     N/2     yes

log(N) by using binary search
