Using Priority Queue with root is median. The 2 children of the root will be 2 medians of the upper and lower array.
Ex: from 1 to 100. A[1] root is 50, a[2] is 25 and a[3] is 75, and so forth.
---> insert a arbitrary number is log ---> binary search
---> find-the-median is a[1] -> constant
---> remove-the-median ---> first
exch(a,1,n);
n-=1;
a[n+1] = null; --> remove the median
sink(a,1n) --> sink it down --> log
